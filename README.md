Classification | Prediction

Problem Statement Summary:
   Predict E-commerce visitor conversion using the provided dataset's "has_converted" target variable. Conduct thorough data exploration, build three classification models, and assess their performance on live stream data, displaying precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score for each model.

Data cleaning and feature engineering:
    The data was cleaned and the features were carefully engineered to avoid the curse of dimensionality whilst maintaining precession

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Utilize data visualization and statistical analysis to understand patterns, relationships, and insights within the dataset, showcasing results in a Streamlit app.

Model Building:
    Implement at least three classification models after preprocessing and feature selection, and evaluate their performance metrics (precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score) using the provided target variable.

Precision and accuracy:
    The model is tested with precision and accuracy and f1 score to ensure best performance and accurate results
